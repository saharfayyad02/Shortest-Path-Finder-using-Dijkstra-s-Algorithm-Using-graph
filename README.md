# Shortest Path Finder using Dijkstra's Algorithm

This program implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in a graph representing cities and towns connected by roads. The input file contains information about the roads connecting cities and towns, including the distance between them. The program constructs a graph based on this information and allows the user to find the shortest path between any two cities/towns entered.

## Implementation Details
- Reads the input file "segments.txt" and loads the road data.
- Constructs a graph representing the cities and towns with roads as edges.
- Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two input points.
- Prints the route of the shortest distance to a file named "route.txt".
- Allows the user to perform multiple shortest path calculations for different pairs of cities/towns.
- Provides a menu-driven interface for ease of use.

## Usage
1. Compile the program.
2. Run the executable.
3. Choose the option to read the input file.
4. Enter two points to compute the shortest path between them.
5. Optionally, choose to save the shortest path to a file.
6. Repeat steps 4-5 for different pairs of cities/towns.
7. Choose the option to exit the program when finished.
